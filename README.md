a collection of scripts to make handling and using CI systems easier

## Features

* script to create a .travis.xml skeleton for usage with magento 1 and 2, also including an Codestyle test
* script to abstract the setup process of magento 1 and 2,
depending on environment variables (created for use with travis CI) 

### Examples of usage

* Cotya/Elasticgento [github](https://github.com/Cotya/Elasticgento) [travis](https://travis-ci.org/Cotya/Elasticgento)


### Version 1 hint

this version will be magento centric, so most of the commands default to magento specific results.
Be prepared that commands and arguments will change in Version 2 (no Roadmap yet)
